# 🏥 OpenEMR Ambulatory Simulation Lab

This hands-on project simulates a real-world ambulatory EMR implementation and support environment using OpenEMR, an open-source EHR system. Tasks include clinical configuration, patient workflow simulation, billing cycle management, and basic interoperability.

## 💡 Lab Objectives

1. Configure a new outpatient clinic and user roles
2. Register patients and manage appointments
3. Document clinical visits using SOAP format
4. Generate CCDs and simulate referrals
5. Assign ICD-10/CPT codes and simulate billing

## ✅ Technologies Used

- OpenEMR (Docker-based local install)
- HL7/CDA export simulation
- Manual CPT code mapping
- Fee Sheet + Ledger + Claims

## 📝 Resume Use Case

> Simulated ambulatory EMR implementation and support workflows using OpenEMR. Configured multi-role clinic access, documented clinical encounters, generated referrals and CCDs, and simulated outpatient billing using CPT/ICD coding and claim generation.
>


Project:
OpenEMR Ambulatory Lab Simulation – Configured outpatient clinic workflows, managed provider scheduling, documented SOAP notes, created referrals, and simulated claim generation using CPT/ICD-10 coding in OpenEMR. Demonstrated end-to-end ambulatory EMR lifecycle support.

Experience:
Transitioned into ambulatory EMR support by building a full OpenEMR lab environment simulating front-desk, provider, and billing workflows. Gained hands-on experience with patient registration, clinical documentation, role-based access, and billing cycle management.
